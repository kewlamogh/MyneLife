### Inpiration and tbh idea
from @bobthetomatoepie or someone like that, they made `repl alone`, which was quite hilarious and I decided to make my own version of it - but in Minecraft. However **none of the code is from him!** 100% me!!
I did get a couple of the feelings (like paranoia and screaming at random stuff) from him.
